# Movie-Search

Web application CinePolis.

## Use of the components:

* It consists of an input field as a search engine with a button and another to be able to filter it by the date of 
departure of the movie or series (It is not necessary if you do not want to filter by date, just do not fill in that field)
* Click on the button to search or press Enter on the input for entrance of films
* Also when scrolling you can continue to visualize your search above in an attenuated tone
* It also contains a button on the bottom right to return to the top of the page (if you click on the gif of the millennium falcon (logo) you will get the same result)

## Built With:

* Makes use of the OMDB api, a database of more than 200,000 movies and series that is constantly updated. You can use it by entering its official website and requesting a free apikey to your email (http://www.omdbapi.com/)
