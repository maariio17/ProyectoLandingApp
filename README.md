#Landing Page:

This is a landing page project of two subjects, where we have learned to work with html, css, jquery and json.

## Use of the components of design:

* Mobile first technique.
* Design for three types of views: mobile, tablet and desktop
* Layout built with CSS Grid technology, FlexBox
* Use of multimedia elements: images, audios and / or videos to support title and subtitle
of your landing page.
* Simple form that must be validated with JQuery.
* Typography, iconography and colors appropriate to the content
* Testimonials / services / products area, made with Grid or FlexBox technology
* Use of white space: the page should not be overloaded, only the
unpredictable and impressive elements.ms

##Technical Aspects of the web:
* Form validation will be done through JQuery, not enabling a field until the
above is filled in correctly.
* The website must dynamically create the sections of Services / Products and Testimonials. For it
you must define the JSON file that represents:
    ** Services: It is a list of services or products offered by the company, where each of
they will have at least one title, text, and
image.
    ** Testimonials: It is a list of testimonials, where each one will have, at least, name, text and
date.

-In the initial loading of the page, said JSON file will be obtained through AJAX and it will be layout
dynamically. At each moment only 3 random testimonials will be shown, even with more in the
archive JSON. The user should be given the ability to change the way they are displayed
these sections

## Built With:

* Makes use of the OMDB api, a database of more than 200,000 movies and series that is constantly updated. You can use it by entering its official website and requesting a free apikey to your email (http://www.omdbapi.com/)
