# Landing Page:

(Click in the logo to visit the web)

## Use of the components of design:

* Mobile first technique.
* Design for three types of views: mobile, tablet and desktop
* Layout built with CSS Grid technology, FlexBox
* Use of multimedia elements: images, audios and / or videos to support title and subtitle
of your landing page.
* Simple form that must be validated with JQuery.
* Typography, iconography and colors appropriate to the content
* Testimonials / services / products area, made with Grid or FlexBox technology
* Use of white space: the page should not be overloaded, only the
unpredictable and impressive elements.ms

## Technical Aspects of the web:
* Form validation will be done through JQuery, not enabling a field until the
above is filled in correctly.
* The website must dynamically create the sections of Services / Products and Testimonials. For it
you must define the JSON file.
* In the initial loading of the page, said JSON file will be obtained through AJAX and it will be layout
dynamically. At each moment only 3 random testimonials will be shown, even with more in the
archive JSON. The user should be given the ability to change the way they are displayed
these sections
* Effects should be applied to services / testimonials
* Every time you change your view the testimonials will have to make an effect to appear / disappear
* We must also keep track of the origin of visits to the web. We will print the Location by console.

## Built With:

* To develop this website, HTML, CSS, javaScript, jQuery and JSON have been used
